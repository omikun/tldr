Illusion of choice - deny freedom to chooce by giving controlling available choices
Reframe goal 

    - "want to keep talking with friends" turns to "which bar has best photos of cocktails on yelp"

FOMO - "wake up in the morning" turns to "check on all the things I've missed while asleep" "how many likes did I get?"

    - irrational fear, we don't miss what we don't see

Slot machine analogy - driven by FOMO, refresh to check what's new (pull lever to see update)

    - email, red number bubbles, notifications, instagram, tinder, 

Social approval - someone tagged/liked/heart a photo of you

    - make you think someone consciously interacted with you
    - but really they are more than likely influenced by design to click a button
    - social reciprocity - tit for tat

Infinite feeds - remove choice to continue by always giving them more

    - autoplay, infinite scrolling

Instant interruption

    - chats demand immediate handling of interruptions with real time notifications
    - heightens urgency and social reciprocity
        - read receipts - other person knows you read their message; implicit demand of your immediate response
    - interruption is good for business

Bundling your reason with their reasons

    - you want milk, grocery store makes you walk through their store to get interacted
    - you want to check on a photo, facebook shoves an infinite feed in your facebook
    - you want to search google (ios), they throw a news feed at you

Inconvenient choices

    - extra hurdles to unsubscribe, disconnect, etc

Forecasting errors

    - never show true cost (time consumed doing task Y)
    - give illusion of quick non-sequiter, derails into hours of procrastination
